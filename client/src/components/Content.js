            <p>Matthew Atchley is currently in the process of changing his career. After working for Whole Foods
                Market as an Assistant Team Leader for 5 years it was time to make a change. He always enjoyed
                traveling from a young age and hopes that becoming an expert coder will allow him to take his work
                wherever he chooses.</p>
            <p>He is passionate about learning about as things big and small. He believes that any problem can be
                examined from multiple angles to determine what is the most effective course of action. But when he
                isnâ€™t trying to absorb all the information around him, Matt enjoys playing guitar, cycling (although
                his bike needs some repair), analyzing media, a finely crafted stout, and working on his next big
                trip.</p>
            <p>Matthew believes that he will use all that this Coding Bootcamp has to offer and move to Dallas
                within the next year with his long time girlfriend. He will spend 2 years working on creating a
                better portfolio and gathering work experience in order to move to Europe, specifically Sweden. He
                fell in love with the country after his visit in December of 2018 and had to find a way to live
                where he can meet more moose and reindeer. Matthew is a dedicated individual who can tackle any
                complex task work related or life related.</p>
